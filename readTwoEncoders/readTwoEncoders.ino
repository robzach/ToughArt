/* Encoder Library - Basic Example
 * http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
 * 
 * modified to read two encoders, one of which is on Uno pins 2 and 4, the other on pins 3 and 5
 * (pins 2 and 3 have interrupts and this library works best if each encoder is attached to 
 * at least one interrupt pin)
 * 
 * Robert Zacharias, rz@rzach.me
 *
 * The original example code is in the public domain as is this modification of it.
 * 
 * v 0.1, 7 Jul. 2017
 *  * modified code to accommodate two encoders
 *  * works well with Serial Plotter
 *  * to do: bound ranges to prepare signal to be transmitted to Processing
 *  
 * v 0.11 7 Jul. 2017
 *  * bounded output range between 0 and 10000
 *  
 * v 0.12 19 Jul. 2017
 *  * added sending reset command via serial when a button is pushed
 *  
 * v 0.2 9 Sep. 2017
 *  * encoders roll over (less than 0 becomes 9999, more than 9999 becomes 0)
 *  * removed reset button
 *  
 * v 0.21 slowwheel branch 12 Sep. 2017
 *  * encoders scale down by a factor of 2, but still send values [0,10000]
 *  * digital pins for noninterrupt pins moved for greater ease of wiring
 *  
 * v 0.22 slowwheel branch 12 Sep. 2017
 *  * horizontal encoder (left) slows down by factor of 3 (screen is about 3:2 so this
 *      roughly equalizes the speeds of both encoders)
